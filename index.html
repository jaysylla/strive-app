  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I graduated from the University of Leeds in 2019 with a BA in International Development, however throughout my university studies I have been focusing on my entrepenurial passions.
    I am a serial entrepeneur and I started my journey making and selling clothes on eBay at 14 years old, that was my first experience of running a business.
    My first experience with coding was in 2019, where I did a basic HTML and CSS course by Code First Girls. I did not stumble into coding again until recently when I realised that I needed to learn how to code in order to develop the mobile app that I am founding.
    I have started writing about my coding journey <a href="https://medium.com/@tdlsocialmedia/so-im-learning-how-to-code-4a870bbfa6fb" "target="_blank">>on Medium</a> under a pseudonym
