  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I graduated from the University of Leeds in 2019 with a BA in International Development, however throughout my university studies I have been focusing on my entrepenurial passions.
    I am a serial entrepeneur and I started my journey making and selling clothes on eBay at 14 years old, that was my first experience of running a business.
    My first experience with coding was in 2019, where I did a basic HTML and CSS course by Code First Girls. I did not stumble into coding again until recently when I realised that I needed to learn how to code in order to develop the mobile app that I am founding.
    I have started writing about my coding journey <a href="https://medium.com/@tdlsocialmedia/so-im-learning-how-to-code-4a870bbfa6fb" "target="_blank">on Medium</a> under a pseudonym

      <h3> Why Strive School? </h3>
I applied to Strive School as I have the goal to become a top software developer, I wanted to join a European Bootcamp in particular as I live in the UK and I felt like a European bootcamp would prepare me for the job market I am going into. <i> I intend to work remotely after graduating Strive School whilst I am building my app in order to supplement my income so I can bootsrtap adequately </i>. 
      In addition to this I was attracted to Strive School as I am aware that Strive School is backed by Y combinator. As an aspiring entrepreneur/someone who is venturing into VC funding, I am very certain that Strive School is the best school for me to start my journey. 
      Plus, I believe that it will be impressive if I note that I trained at a Y-Combinator backed School in my future VC funding journey. 
The technical aspect of Strive School has also attracted me to apply, the curriculum is appealing and will enable me to become a full stack developer. 
      The wide range of topics covered will allow me to build my app but also allow me to get a job in the European job market.
